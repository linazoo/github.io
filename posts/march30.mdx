I'm feeling exhausted this week. Even though I've been really picky about where I've applied for jobs and how many jobs I apply for in a week I'm getting pretty bombarded right now. I think that is a good problem to have, but at the same time I'm not sure how I'm coming off to some of these companies interviewing me. When I first started on this journey about two months ago, I told myself I wanted to give myself time to 'catch up' and focus on learning. I have done that through a couple of courses I've taken on ui.dev, but now that I started getting call backs the interview process seems to be taking up all my mental capacity. Which brings me to the question - how many technical interviews a week is too many? I'm currently in this situation and I guess it just depends on what company. I'm interviewing for a Design Technologist role at an agency right now and their interviews have been a breeze but I've also gotten some red flags on their process and how my life will actually be on the job so that's in the back of my mind. Meanwhile, I've also got a technical interview with a well known fintech company and they told me they do 5 interviews(!) in total, the first one is HTML/CSS/JS/API, second one is algorithms, third is architecture, fourth is foundation which is about leadership and impact and the fifth is onsite. I think this process is awfully long but I also know that their process is different in the sense that they will interview me and then the teams will 'shop' for candidates like me to see if I can fit into the whole process. I'm just worried about burning myself out. Next week I have two technical interviews and I have someone else reaching out to me about another phone screen and I don't want to tell them 'no' but I also don't want to get burned out. I talked to my mentor and he said "this is your journey, not theirs" but I definitely feel spoiled when I say "Oh hey FAANG company, I don't have time for you this week or next but here's my availability the week after' Is that rude? I guess we will see beacuse that is exactly what I just replied to them ðŸ˜…
