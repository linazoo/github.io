title: I quit my UI Engineer role in finance
description: Best decision ever!
date: Feb 4th, 2022

I started 2022 really excited about what the possibilities were and being at a 9-5 where I had an amazing team and culture but no challenges when it came to engineering and development, I knew I had to make some changes. I quit my job in finance as a User Interface Engineer and today it has been a month and ten days and I have three interviews lined in up in the next week.
I have been learning every single day and coding almost every single day. I've also been making new habits so I've been writing for 2 mintues every day (with the advice from Atomic Habits book) and painting more often.
