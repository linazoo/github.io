I'm moving this part of my personal diary to my blog because it's taking over my personal/hobbies diary and, i cant.

The whole job situation is going pretty well right now, I'm interviwing at Frog Design for a Design Technologist which is basically a front end developer. The manager is a game developer (from what I'm been able to gather online about him) and he was pretty nice when I talked to him on my first interview. It wasn't very technical at all. We from chatted about my experience and how I got into coding, to housing prices is Austin. This was the second interview (first was from the recruiter). I also have my second interview with Robinhood which is the first of 5 (!)and most include algorithm questions -\_-

In other career but also community news - I've joined the board for Future Front TX. They voted for me and I found out last week. The first meeting w them is april 9 and I'm really excited. They're taking headshots too yall!
